# Traffic-Signal-Detection-For-Indian-Scenario
Dataset
Dataset is the most important aspect of this subsection. For creating a robust
detector which is valid and relevant for Indian Scenario. Dataset is collected
from the Roads of Lucknow City . Due to some restrictions only
a small dataset of 111 images could be created but with the help of transfer
learning a model was created.
\newlineImplementation
It has been implemented by Training YoloV3 for object detection
with Custom Data using OpenCV, Python and Deep Learning. The method
used here is Transfer Learning.
